The "Game of Life" is a famous example of a cellular automaton created by British mathematician John Conway in 1970.

The algorithm implemented here is a fairly crude one. A map is constructed of 'cell' enums (which can be dead or alive), which are iterated over using the rules above. The runtime complexity is than O(n * m) where n and m are the width and height respectively.

A very fast and more complex algorithm called "HashLife" is also possible that makes use of a QuadTree structure as well as a cache of next generations for cell arrangements.

SwiftUI was used for the UI. Performance could likely be improved with a lower-level UIKit implementation.
